        <p>I found a course on Udemy that teaches how to write<br>
             clean code in an example-driven way. <br>
             The course is called Clean Code and is highly rated <br>
             by over 10,000 students. The course covers topics such as<br>
              naming things properly, avoiding common pitfalls and mistakes,<br>
               writing clean functions, and much more. <br>
               The course is taught in English and is priced at $129.991.</p>

            <p>I also found a corporate training program offered by ExcelR<br>
                 that provides customized training according to the needs<br>
                  of the organization. The training is instructor-led <br>
                  and hands-on with practical exercises2.</p>
